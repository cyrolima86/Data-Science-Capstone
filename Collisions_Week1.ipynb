    "This notebook will describe the methodology to assess collisions data obtained from Seattle city, wich are data provided by SPD and recorded by traffic records, including all types of collisions, displayed at the intersection or mid-bloc of a segment, since 2004.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem consists in correctly assess a driver that wants to know the probability of get involved in an accident, based on weather conditions, road conditions and the previous history of that highway/road segment, allowing him to drive more carefully or even change course if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this work is to analyze data in order to provide a model that will predict the severity of an accident/collision, given a number of features that will be extracted from the data. The model will classify and predict severity, so a driver can use this model to change course or drive more carefully, given that he isn't want to get involved into an accident, since the consequences can be unpredictable.\n",
